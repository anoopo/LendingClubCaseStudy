## General Information
- **Background:** Lending Club is a leading online loan marketplace that connects borrowers with investors. The company faces the challenge of identifying risky loan applicants to minimize credit loss.
- **Business Problem:** The project aims to identify the driving factors behind loan defaults, enabling Lending Club to improve its risk assessment and loan approval processes. This will help reduce financial losses caused by borrowers who default on their loans.
- **Dataset:** The project uses the Lending Club loan dataset, which contains information about loan applications, borrower demographics, loan characteristics, and loan performance. It is a publicly available dataset.

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1:** Loans with a term of 60 months have a significantly higher risk of default compared to loans with a term of 36 months.
- **Conclusion 2:**  The charge-off percentage steadily increases as loan grades decline, with Grade G loans showing the highest risk.
- **Conclusion 3:**  Small business loans experience a significant jump in charge-off representation, raising concerns about the heightened default risk associated with this sector.
- **Conclusion 4:** Borrowers with 1 or more public record bankruptcies have a significantly higher charged-off percentage, making it a key risk factor.
