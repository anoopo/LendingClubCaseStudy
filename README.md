# LendingClub Case Study
> Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the historical data about the loan remittance from a company which is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Different Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniquest are used to identify the patterns and factors that may contribute the defaulting of the loans. This will help the company in minimizing the credit risk and improve the loan portfolio quality.improving loan portfolio quality.
